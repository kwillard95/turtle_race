# turtle_race

## Description

#### This is a game where you place a bet on one of the racing turtles. The turtles move at random speeds, so you can't be sure which one will win until the race ends! 

## How to run

#### Run `main.py` in your console and a window will pop up. Once the window pops up, 5 turtles will get created and you input one of the five turtles that you want to place your bet on. In the end, the result will be displayed in the console.

### Details

#### This is an exercise leveraging the existing turtle module, enabling one to explore the different features within a `Turtle` class.
